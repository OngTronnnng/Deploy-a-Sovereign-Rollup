# Deploy-a-Sovereign-Rollup
# To deploy a Cosmos-SDK application on Celestia Network, you will need to do the following:
- Install Celestia Network: You need to download and install Celestia Network on your computer. Celestia Network provides you with a test release so you can start testing and developing on it.
- Create a Cosmos-SDK application: You need to create a new Cosmos-SDK application or use an existing Cosmos-SDK application. If you use an existing Cosmos-SDK application, you need to modify some components so that it can run on Celestia Network.
- Register your application with Celestia Network: You need to register your application with Celestia Network by creating a registration form and submitting it to the Celestia Network development team.
- Develop and test your application: After registering your application, you can start developing and testing your application on Celestia Network. Celestia Network provides you with tools and resources to develop and test your application on it.
- Deploy your application on Celestia Network: After completing development and testing of your application, you can deploy it on Celestia Network using the tools and resources provided by Celestia Network.
# To deploy a Cosmos-SDK application on the Celestia network, we need to do the following steps:
1. Install the necessary tools
Before you start, you need to install Go and Cosmos-SDK. Install Go according to the instructions on the Go homepage, and then use Go to install the Cosmos-SDK with the following command:

$ go get github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk

2. Create application project
Create the application project with the command "cosmos-sdk init":

$ cosmos-sdk init myapp --chain-id=mychain

Where "myapp" is the name of the application project, :mychain" is the name of the string your application will run on.

3. Create module
Create the module with the command "cosmos-sdk create module":

$ cosmos-sdk create module mymodule

Where "mymodule" is the name of your module.

4. Add the code of the application
After creating the module, add the application's code to the module. For example, you can add code to the "mymodule" module using the "cosmos-sdk add genutil" command.

5. Compile and run the application
Compile the application with the "make" command:

$ cd myapp
$ make

After successful compilation, we can run the application with the command "myappd start":

$ myappd start

Your application will run on the Celestia network.

# Note: This is just a simple guide to deploying a Cosmos-SDK application on the Celestia network. In practice, the application deployment process can be more complex depending on the nature of the application and the network it will run on.
